Notes from looking at sample maps
=================================

1. [*etort-231*](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%28233%29) looks like it should come from someplace further south.  It's sampling location ([map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/35%C2%B025%2756.4%22N+114%C2%B039%2753.6%22W/@34.5827913,-115.1443571,9z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x0)) is in the Grand Canyon, in the middle of a reservoir.  Probably **sample mislabeling?**
2. [*etort-1*](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%28272%29) 
    looks intermediate between purple and blue.
3. Other othermediates with a simliar pattern 
    occur in the Searchlight area, e.g. 
    [etort-232](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%28235%29) or 
    [etort-271](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%28235%29).
4. But, *etort-1* still shows isolation by distance: it is most related to its nearest neighbor, [etort-37](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%281%29).
    Maybe this is because there's a tortoise population on the east side of Death Valley (e.g. up the Owens valley)
    but Death Valley is (or was) a barrier they had to go around.  Maybe two range expansions met where etort-1 lives.
5. In the Kelso area, most tortoises are blue, but one ([etort-70](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%2896%29)) is purple.
    However, they all look pretty different to their nearest neighbors to the south ([etort-44](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%28104%29))
    and to the north, in the Ivanpah ([etort-46](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%2893%29))
6. [**etort-37**](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%281%29), and its neighbors in the northwest except etort-1,
    have two "shelves" that don't fit isolation by distance.
    The top cloud of purple points are comparisons to the Eastern Mojave
    -- and, if you measured distance going south around Death Valley,
    they'd move to the right with the rest of the pattern of IBD.
    On the other hand, the lower horizontal line of blue points
    is comparisons to the tortoises in the northeast,
    e.g. [etort-243](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%28255%29);
    to these, we see no isolation by distance.
    This is consistent with a **range expansion** from the Ivanpah area northwards.
7. Those northeast tortoises, e.g. [etort-243](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%28255%29)
    show *two* lines of increasing isolation by distance:
    the lower one goes down into the Ivanpah and Kelso;
    the upper one goes down the west side of the Colorado river by Searchlight
    and connects to the southern tortoises.
    So, etort-243 is more closely related to the tortoises in the Ivanpah even though it is goegraphically closer to those by the Colorado,
    probably because of the admixture in the Searchlight area.
8. More on the northward expansion:
    tortoises in the middle of the expansion, like
    [etort-203](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%2815%29)
    or
    [etort-236](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%28269%29),
    have a horizontal line of relationships to tortoises further out in the expansion than they are.
9. More on the admixture near Searchlight on the Colorado River:
    purple tortoises south of Kelso, e.g.
    [etort-43](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%28106%29)
    clearly show two bands in the IBD plot, purple and blue,
    but these are pulled towards each other for the tortoises (both blue and purple)
    in this area.
10. Tortoises at the very western edge of the range, e.g. 
    [etort-119](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%28132%29)
    show lower divergence to their neighbors
    -- is this another range expansion, or just lower density/edge of the range?
    If it was a range expansion, there should be tortoises from which all these had the same divergence,
    which doesn't seem to be the case.
11. [etort-273](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_rainbow_distance_maps/#%2867%29)
    is more closely related to the tortoises in the western Mojave
    than to the ones that are much closer, around Joshua Tree and north of the Salton Sea.
    This is probably because there is more habitat down to the south, towards Baja --
    so a lineage that starts near the Salton sea is reasonably likely to head south 
    and take much longer to coalesce with etort-273
    than a lineage in the western Mojave,
    that can't go as many places.

    
    

Error rates
===========

1. **etort-97** has much higher error rates (and wacky base composition);
    this is seen by higher divergence 
    [at all sites](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_sites_minus_het_distance_maps/#%28204%29);
    but strangely, has slightly lower divergence than it should 
    [at angsd-polymorphic sites](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%28204%29)
    -- compare to its neighbors, e.g. 
    [etort-253](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%28206%29)
    or 
    [etort-278](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%28203%29).
2. There is small but noticible variance in patterns of divergence of nearby tortoises with respect to everyone else;
    the best example might be
    [etort-252](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%2813%29)
    and
    [etort-286](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%2812%29)
    -- this is probably due to differing sequencing error.
3. Putative cousins:
    - [etort-187](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%2827%29) and 
        [etort-179](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%2828%29)
    - [etort-185](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%2830%29) and
        [etort-172](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%2826%29)
    - [etort-42](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%2842%29) and
        [etort-135](http://phoebe.usc.edu/tortoises/all_angsd_snps_distance_maps/#%2862%29)
