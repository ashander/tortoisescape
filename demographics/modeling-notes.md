1.  expansion in the north (and south?) that moves into the north and recontacts the south

2.  constant lightly leaky barrier between the two


Barrier:
    - 18Kya  (Afton Canyon)
    - leakiness: do calc from panmictic pops

Expansion:
    - 200 Kya ??


# Run the code:

1.  Models are set up in `model-setup-msarg.R` **if first** the corresponding `.RData` files are deleted.
2.  Trees are simulated with `ms`, these are processed, and information is written to e.g. `barrier.ms`.
3.  PNGs of IBD plots can be made by running e.g. `Rscript ms-maps.R barrier.ms`.
