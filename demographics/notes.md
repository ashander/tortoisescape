- mating in the spring, males search in home ranges (Berry '86)

- females lay 1-2 clutches of 1-7 eggs each (Turner et al '86)

- "Incubation temperature has a direct effect on sex determination of the desert tortoise.
    Low temperatures (26.0-30.6 C) produce males and high temperatures (32.8-35.3 C) produce
    females. Pivotal temperature is approximately 31.8 C." (Spotila et al 1994)

- *lose* energy eating spring annuals; gain energy through dry forage, but need water for this
    * "growth (as protein deposition) and net acquisition of energy may be temporally decoupled in desert tortoises, which has
    potential consequences for geographic variation in life history traits." (Petersen 1996)

- Wallis et al found a size-number tradeoff in eggs between western (Goffs) and eastern (DTNA) Mojave; explains by summer rainfall in east

- "desert tortoises may have fairly large home ranges (1-89 ha, Berry, 1986)" (O'Connor et al 1994; found 10-30 ha (female) or 20-50 ha (male) home ranges)
    * "Tortoises varied widely in their habitat
    use without any clear fidelity to particular
    areas, topographic features (e.g., washes),
    or substrata. Most tortoises remained on
    the floor of the valley throughout the time
    they were followed, but several tortoises
    climbed, at least briefly, onto the hills bounding the valley, finding refuge in ca-
    liche dens (Fig. 1)."
    - movements over days ~ exponentially distributed with mean ~ 200m
    - lots of "home range" overlap esp betw sexes.  also sharing of burrows.

Total numbers:
- tens or hundreds of thousands on 25% of original habitat of Western Mojave (Chambers Group 1990)

threats:

- development (ft irwin!)
- shooting
- ravens
- grazing
- drought
- mycoplasma (URTD)



- Big modeling effort: "Modeling Population Viability for the Desert Tortoise in the Western Mojave Desert"
    * size-structured
    * "Since there are almost no published demographic stud-
    ies for the desert tortoise (and absolutely none for the
    Western Mojave region), we were forced to rely heavily
    on unpublished government reports and on unanalyzed
    mark-recapture data gathered for the BLM under the
    supervision of Dr. Kristin Berry at eight permanent
    study plots throughout the Western Mojave desert (see
    Table 1; descriptions of the sites can be found in Berry
    1984 and 1990). Further details on our analysis of this
    data are presented in Chambers Group (1991)."
