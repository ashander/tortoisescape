These are the "hybrids" near Searchlight:
```
    eog all_angsd_snps_rainbow_distance_maps/*etort-{271,7,35}.png
```
Note that their relationships to others are highly correlated even though they aren't direct neighbors.

---------

In the Kelso area, **etort-70** goes the opposite way from the others.  
Like the others just over the Granites to the south, it is closest to the ones to the east,
even closer than to its neighbors.
Possibly mislabeled?

---------

**etort-231** is clearly mislabeled, and should be directly south.

--------

These three neighbors:
```
    eog all_angsd_snps_rainbow_distance_maps/*etort-{258,272,113}.png
```
are all very similar in terms of divergence to northern pops,
but **etort-272** is much closer to the Ivanpah samples than the neighbors...
but simliarly close to Ivanpah as the northeastern tortoises are.
