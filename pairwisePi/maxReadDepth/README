1st_1million_900readmax.pwp
	This dataset takes the first 1 million bp from the read set that sets maximum of 900 reads 
	for all 180 samples cumulatively. It uses these to calculate pwp using the following awk script:

{ 
    for ( N=1; N<=(NF/2); N++ ) { 
        D[N] = ( $(2*N-1) + $(2*N)  );  # total coverage
        if ( D[N] > 0 ) {
            P[N] = $(2*N-1) / D[N];  # major allele freq
            if ( D[N] > 1 ) {
                W[N,N] += D[N]*(D[N]-1) ;   # weights
                PI[N,N] += 2 * D[N] * P[N] * ( D[N] - $(2*N-1) ) / (D[N]-1) ;  # prob of difference
            }
            for ( M=1; M<N; M++ ) {
                if (D[M] > 0) {
                    WW = D[N]*D[M] ;
                    W[N,M] += WW;
                    PI[N,M] += ( P[N]*(1-P[M]) + P[M]*(1-P[N]) ) * WW;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

END { 
    for ( N=1; N<=(NF/2); N++ ) { 
        for ( M=1; M<=N; M++ ) { 
            print ( W[N,M]>0 ? PI[N,M]/W[N,M] : "NA" ); 
        } 
    } 
}



first10mil_max900_weighted.pwp
	This is the same as 1st_1million_900readmax.pwp except it uses the first 10million base pairs. Again,
	it discards sites that have aggregate coverage of over 900 (average of 5 reads per sample). It uses the
	same awk commands as above


max5reads_1milpolymorphicsites.pwp
	This file is a pairwise pi calculation using the set of 1 million putative polymorphic sites as determined
	by angsd. Instead of filtering out sites that have population-wide coverage of 900 or above, it adds a 
	condition to the awk script to make sure that neither sample N nor M has a coverage greater than 5 at that
	site. That modified awk script is below:

{ 
    for ( N=1; N<=(NF/2); N++ ) { 
        D[N] = ( $(2*N-1) + $(2*N)  );  # total coverage
        if ( D[N] > 0) {
            P[N] = $(2*N-1) / D[N];  # major allele freq
            if ( D[N] > 1 ) {
                if (D[N] < 6) { # Set a maximum of 5 reads for N
                    W[N,N] += D[N]*(D[N]-1) ;   # weights
                    PI[N,N] += 2 * D[N] * P[N] * ( D[N] - $(2*N-1) ) / (D[N]-1) ;  # prob of difference
                }
            }
            for ( M=1; M<N; M++ ) {
                if (D[M] > 0) {  
                    if (D[M] < 6) {  # Set a maximum of 5 reads for M
                        WW = D[N]*D[M] ;
                        W[N,M] += WW;
                        PI[N,M] += ( P[N]*(1-P[M]) + P[M]*(1-P[N]) ) * WW;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

END { 
    for ( N=1; N<=(NF/2); N++ ) { 
        for ( M=1; M<=N; M++ ) { 
            print ( W[N,M]>0 ? PI[N,M]/W[N,M] : "NA" ); 
        } 
    } 
}



max9reads_1milpolymorphicsites.pwp
	This is similar to the file max5reads_1milpolymorphicsites.pwp. It runs a divergence calculation on 
	1 million sites determined to be polymorphic by angsd. It only considers a site if the read depth is 
	less than 10 for sample N and M (I think). The modified awk script is below:

{ 
    for ( N=1; N<=(NF/2); N++ ) { 
        D[N] = ( $(2*N-1) + $(2*N)  );  # total coverage
        if ( D[N] > 0) {
            P[N] = $(2*N-1) / D[N];  # major allele freq
            if ( D[N] > 1 ) {
                if (D[N] < 10) { # Set a maximum of 10 reads for N
                    W[N,N] += D[N]*(D[N]-1) ;   # weights
                    PI[N,N] += 2 * D[N] * P[N] * ( D[N] - $(2*N-1) ) / (D[N]-1) ;  # prob of difference
                }
            }
            for ( M=1; M<N; M++ ) {
                if (D[M] > 0) {  # Set a maximum of 10 reads for M
                    if (D[M] < 10) {
                        WW = D[N]*D[M] ;
                        W[N,M] += WW;
                        PI[N,M] += ( P[N]*(1-P[M]) + P[M]*(1-P[N]) ) * WW;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

END { 
    for ( N=1; N<=(NF/2); N++ ) { 
        for ( M=1; M<=N; M++ ) { 
            print ( W[N,M]>0 ? PI[N,M]/W[N,M] : "NA" ); 
        } 
    } 
}




max8reads_1milpolymorphicsites.pwp
	Same as the 5-read max and 9-read max versions above, except the maximum number of reads for sample
	N or M is 8. awk scrip is below:

{ 
    for ( N=1; N<=(NF/2); N++ ) { 
        D[N] = ( $(2*N-1) + $(2*N)  );  # total coverage
        if ( D[N] > 0) {
            P[N] = $(2*N-1) / D[N];  # major allele freq
            if ( D[N] > 1 ) {
                if (D[N] < 9) { # Set a maximum of 10 reads for N
                    W[N,N] += D[N]*(D[N]-1) ;   # weights
                    PI[N,N] += 2 * D[N] * P[N] * ( D[N] - $(2*N-1) ) / (D[N]-1) ;  # prob of difference
                }
            }
            for ( M=1; M<N; M++ ) {
                if (D[M] > 0) {  # Set a maximum of 9 reads for M
                    if (D[M] < 9) {
                        WW = D[N]*D[M] ;
                        W[N,M] += WW;
                        PI[N,M] += ( P[N]*(1-P[M]) + P[M]*(1-P[N]) ) * WW;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

END { 
    for ( N=1; N<=(NF/2); N++ ) { 
        for ( M=1; M<=N; M++ ) { 
            print ( W[N,M]>0 ? PI[N,M]/W[N,M] : "NA" );
